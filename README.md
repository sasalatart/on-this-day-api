      console.log(response);
    }
  });

#### Births And Deaths

The API is the same for births and deaths, but instead of making a call to `/events`, it should be done to either `/births` or `/deaths`.

## Setup

#### Development

1. Clone and cd into this repository
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Turn on Postgres
4. Run `bundle exec rake db:reset`
5. Run `shotgun config.ru`

#### Docker

```sh
# Run database
$ docker run -d --name=postgres_db postgres:9.6.1

# Run API
$ docker run -d --name=onthisday -p 80:9292 --link=postgres_db:postgres_db sasalatart/onthisday

# Setup the database
$ docker exec onthisday /bin/sh -c 'rake db:reset'
```

The server's machine should now be redirecting its port 80 to the container's port 9292.
